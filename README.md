Key Features:

1. Product turnover analysis using RANK() and CASE
2. Reorder point & safety stock estimation with AVG(), STDDEV(), and LAG()
3. Monthly and bi-annual inventory insights
4. Weather and seasonality-based demand forecasting
5. Designed to support smarter replenishment, reduce holding costs, and enable real-time inventory decision-making
